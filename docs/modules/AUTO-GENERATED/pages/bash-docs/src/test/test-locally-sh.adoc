Run on localhost to test this actions Docker image.

== Overview

Run this script on your localhost to build as (tagged as
`local/generate-docs-action:dev`) and run the image. When running this image locally the
`docs/modules/AUTO-GENERATED` Antora module is generated based in bash scripts from this repo.

Keep in mind that the Docker container is run as root due to Github Action policy. Due to this
link:https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3002[Hadolint rule DL3002] is disabled.

[quote, https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/dockerfile-support-for-github-actions#user]
*__
Docker actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Do not use the USER instruction in
your Dockerfile, because you won't be able to access the GITHUB_WORKSPACE.
__*

When running the image locally the `docs/modules/AUTO-GENERATED` directory is owned by `root`.
To remove this directory `sudo` is required.

==== Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.
