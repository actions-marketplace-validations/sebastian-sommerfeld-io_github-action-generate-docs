# test-locally.sh

Run on localhost to test this actions Docker image.

## Overview

Run this script on your localhost to build as (tagged as
``local/generate-docs-action:dev``) and run the image. When running this image locally the
``docs/modules/AUTO-GENERATED`` Antora module is generated based in bash scripts from this repo.

Keep in mind that the Docker container is run as root due to Github Action policy:

[quote, https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/dockerfile-support-for-github-actions#user]
____
Docker actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Do not use the USER instruction in
your Dockerfile, because you won't be able to access the GITHUB_WORKSPACE.
____

When running the image locally the ``docs/modules/AUTO-GENERATED`` directory is owned by ``root``.
To remove this directory ``sudo`` is required.

==== Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.
